A set of experimental Contracts for the [Sui](https://sui.io/) Network.  
Once these modules go live, they are moved to their own repos.
  
## Quick start  
  
Make sure you have the latest version of the Sui binaries installed on your machine

[Instructions here](https://docs.sui.io/devnet/build/install)

### Run tests

**To run the tests on the dex directory**

```bash
  cd clamm
  sui move test
```

### Publish

```bash
  cd clamm
  sui client publish --gas-budget 500000000
```

## Repo Structure

- **library:** It contains utility functions that are used by other modules
- **airdrop:** It contains the module to airdrop the IPX governance token to whitelisted accounts
- **examples:** A myriad of examples on how to interact with various modules
- **audits** It contains code audits
- **i256** A library to
- **clamm** UniswapV3 in Move (WIP)

## Security

Even though the code is tested, please use the code at your own risk. Only the directories below are audited.

- **dex:** Audited by Movebit.

## Functionality

### CLAMM

The Interest Protocol Concentrated Liquidity AMM

Users will be able to perform all traditional functions of an AMM

**Innovation**: LP providers will be able to automatically list their out of money liquidity positions on a Money Market to earn yield. The protocol will withdraw the collateral once the liquidity becomes on the money.

### Airdrop

It contains the airdrop module for the IPX governance coin. It distributes the tokens linearly to whitelisted addresses using a merkle tree.

### Examples

- **airdrop-tree:** A typescript implementation of a merkle tree to use with the airdrop module
